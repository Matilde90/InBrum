Tolkien grew up by the fields and mill at Sarehole, a village now absorbed into Birmingham’s suburbs, from which he took inspiration for ‘The Shire’ (The Hobbit). Perrott’s Folly and the Waterworks Tower in Edgbaston, as well as Old Joe, the University of Birmingham’s clock tower, were his sources of inspiration for the tower of Orthanc, the black tower of Isengard (The Lord of the Rings). </p>
